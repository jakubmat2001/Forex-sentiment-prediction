"AUD/USD Strength Dented on Big Jobs Report Miss, RBA Q3 Contraction View Bolstered","The Australian Dollar took a hit after a downbeat jobs report revealed the economy lost a massive 146.3k jobs in August, relative to the -80.0k Bloomberg consensus forecast. The unemployment rate ticked down to a percentage point to 4.5% against an expected 5.0%. A drop in the labor force participation rate likely pushed the jobless rate lower despite fewer employed citizens. A wave of lockdowns, mostly across New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, are the likely culprits fueling the big employment losses. AUD/USD was benefiting from a bout of risk-taking before the data print but appears to be tracking slightly lower in response to the headline figures. Some economists are expecting growth to contract in the third quarter due to the expansive Covid-related restriction measures. Earlier this week, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe stepped in line with that view. The RBA chief stated that he expects the Q3 contraction to be 2% or larger, along with a jobless rate in the high 5% range. This employment report bolsters Mr. Lowe’s growth contraction hypothesis. While the market is pricing in a rate hike in 2023, Mr. Lowe said 2024 will likely be the liftoff point. The faraway target relative to other more hawkish central banks is another headwind for the Aussie Dollar. Still, as vaccination rates increase, a comeback in the fourth quarter may be on the cards. Australian policymakers have pushed hard to amp up the country’s vaccination campaign. The government is targeting an 80% vaccination rate for those 16 and over by December. Travel restrictions and lockdown measures will be largely pulled back at that time under the current plan. If pent-up demand is stronger than expected, it may help spur some more aggressive rate bets for the RBA. Until then, however, the Australian Dollar’s path of least resistance appears to be lower."
AUD/USD Rate to Face Contraction in Australia Employment,"Looking ahead, fresh data prints coming out of Australia may drag on AUD/USD as employment is projected to fall 90.0K in August, while the jobless rate is expected to widen to 4.9% from 4.6% during the same period. In response, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) may retain the current course for monetary policy as the central bank warns that “the Delta outbreak is expected to delay, but not derail, the recovery,” and Governor Philip Lowe and Co. may stick to the same script at its next interest rate decision on October 5 as “the Board is committed to maintaining highly supportive monetary conditions to achieve a return to full employment in Australia and inflation consistent with the target.” Until then, signs of a slowing recovery in Australia may weigh on AUD/USD as the RBA plans to carry out its government bond purchase program at a pace of A$4B a week “until at least mid February 2022,” but a further decline in the exchange rate may fuel the recent flip in retail sentiment like the behavior seen earlier this year."
"AUD/USD Gains on Solid GDP Beat, Will Australian Dollar Continue Higher?","AUD/USD found some footing after Australian GDP came in at 0.7% q/q for the 2nd quarter against expectations of 0.4%, according to a Bloomberg survey. Annual GDP had some upward revisions and printed at 9.6% against 9.1% expected. The market was surprised by the solid result as the second quarter GDP number was impacted by early Covid-19 Delta variant lockdowns. The largest economy of New South Wales (NSW) was in lockdown in June, but other states were yet to do so. The full impact of other lockdowns, particularly the additional Victorian ones, will not be fully exposed until the 3rd quarter data. The Q3 GDP will also be dependent on the easing of these restrictions as vaccinations rates are expected to move above the targeted 70% in October in some states. The S&P/ASX 200 moved slightly higher in response to the data, as the market interpreted the implications of lockdowns against the profit reporting season. Current estimates are for a record of over AUD 34 billion being paid in dividends this reporting season as well as large share buy-backs being announced. AUD/USD turned a bid which went against the grain of iron ore prices as the commodity resumed a move lower after Chinese PMI data disappointed yesterday."
Australian Dollar Jumps as RBA Preferred CPI Beats Estimates. Can AUD/USD Go Higher?,"The Australian Dollar rose immediately after the Australian CPI numbers today. Third quarter headline inflation came in at 0.8% q/q against expectations of 0.8%. The annual headline rate came in 3.0% y/y versus 3.1% forecasted. The RBA’s preferred measure of trimmed mean printed at 0.7% q/q instead 0.5% anticipated, which made the annual read 2.1% y/y against 1.8% expected. This means that headline CPI had some downward revisions, but trimmed mean had some upward revisions. The 3rd quarter saw more than 50% of the Australian population in lockdown and economic activity was understandably expected to fall away. Consequently, price pressures were also anticipated to be benign. The uptick in the trimmed mean CPI is not desirable for the RBA, but it is unlikely to be enough to change their tightening agenda. Globally, inflation is a hot topic. Supply chain issues aside, energy prices have sky-rocketed over the last few months as the northern hemisphere prepares to go into winter. A number of factors have led to demand out-stripping supply. In North America, a challenging hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico sapped output. Taking a look across the Atlantic, a broken gas pipe between the UK and Europe and Russia holding out on the EU to get their pipe under the Balkans approved kept prices afloat. Meanwhile, China and India are competing for power to reduce rolling blackouts. This is as the Asian typhoon season wreaks havoc and closes several mines. Shipping costs are through the roof as ports remain clogged due to Covid and OPEC+ under supplying oil. As the world vaccinates and reactivates economically, some of these issues will likely be mitigated. That may not happen for some time and high energy prices might stay with us. Although the cost of domestic energy is regulated in most parts of the world, this has led to many energy supply companies going broke. These energy companies are forced to buy wholesale power at high prices and sell it at mandated lower prices to retail consumers. Without large government subsidies, this is not sustainable. Eventually, consumers will face higher prices. Unless something drastic changes, these inflation pressures are coming down the pipe, but the timing of when they surface is not yet known. If high energy prices stay with us for the long haul, the implications are two-fold for the Australian Dollar. Firstly, as an energy exporting country, this will likely lead to a better bottom line on the trade balance and consequent buying of AUD. Secondly, high inflation might be stickier than central banks are anticipating. It could lead to a monetary policy tightening race, driving up rates. How quickly the RBA responds may determine yields across the curve, and this can play a role in the attractiveness or otherwise of the Australian Dollar."
AUD/USD Rate to Face Another Decline in Australia Employment,"However, fresh data prints coming out of Australia may drag on AUD/USD as employment is expected to fall 137.5K job September after contracting 146.3K the month prior, and the recent weakness in the labor market may keep the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on the sidelines as the central bank acknowledges that “the Delta outbreak has interrupted the recovery of the Australian economy and GDP is expected to have declined materially in the September quarter.” As a result, Governor Philip Lowe and Co. appear to be on track to retain the current course for monetary policy as “the outbreak of the Delta variant had delayed, but not derailed, the recovery,” and the Australian Dollar may face headwinds ahead of the next RBA meeting on November 2 as the central bank relies on its non-standard measures to support the economy. In turn, the deviating paths between the RBA and Federal Reserve may keep a lid on AUD/USD as Chairman Jerome Powell and Co. unveil a tentative exit strategy, but a further advance in the exchange rate may fuel the recent flip in retail sentiment like the behavior seen earlier this year."
"Australian Dollar Volatility Remains In-Check, Despite Big Beat On Retail Sales Data. Where to for AUD/USD?","The Australian Dollar had weakened going into the data as risk aversion took hold across the board today. Retail sales for the month of October came in at 4.9%, well above forecasts of 2.2% and the previous month’s 1.3%. AUD/USD initially found some support, but risk assets such as the Aussie remain under pressure. October saw the easing of Covid restrictions in the two most populous states of New South Wales and Victoria and this clearly impacted economic activity. The RBA will be combing through the components of the data very carefully as this is the first read of how the country is fairing economically post lock-down. The RBA have previously said that they see the current high inflation as temporary. The latest data on prices saw 3rd quarter headline inflation came in at 0.8% q/q against expectations of 0.8%. The annual headline rate came in 3.0% y/y versus 3.1% forecasted. The RBA’s preferred measure, trimmed mean, printed at 0.7% q/q instead of 0.5% anticipated, which made the annual read 2.1% y/y against 1.8% expected. 3rd quarter GDP, due for release on December 1st, is likely to be a soft number as Covid-19 restrictions were at their most severe. With lockdown restrictions having now eased, economic activity for the 4th quarter could be of more importance to the RBA going forward. The RBA next meet on Tuesday 7th December. Prior to the data, the S&P/ASX 200 was already lower and was little changed after the data, trading at 7.261. Similarly, bonds markets were little moved with Australian 10-year government yields remaining steady at around 1.81%. The spread over US 10-year government yields remains at 0.22%. It would appear that AUD/USD is likely to be vulnerable to external factors. Bond markets, both domestically and in the US, might be a catalyst for the currency to move, particularly if the spreads between the two widen or narrow significantly. Fed speakers will be a focus for markets as their path to reducing stimulus remains opaque. Commodities may also play a role as iron ore continues to languish, but energy commodity prices remain highly volatile."
AUD/USD to Defend Monthly Opening Range on Upbeat Australia Jobs Report,"However, AUD/USD may attempt to defend the monthly low (0.7360) as Australia’s Employment report is anticipated to show the economy adding 50K jobs in October, while the Unemployment Rate is seen widening to 4.8% from 4.6% during the same period as discouraged workers return to the labor force. A positive development may push the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to adopt a hawkish forward guidance as the central bank removes its yield-curve control (YCC) program, and it remains to be seen if the central bank will show a greater willingness to implement higher interest rates sooner rather than later as “the decision to discontinue the yield target reflects the improvement in the economy and the earlier-than-expected progress towards the inflation target.” At the same time, a weaker-than-expected employment report may produce headwinds for the Australian Dollar as it encourages the RBA to retain the current policy at the next interest rate decision on December 7, but a further decline in AUD/USD may fuel the recent flip in retail sentiment like the behavior seen earlier this year."
Australian Dollar Forecast: AUD/USD Muted on Rosy Jobs Report as Iron Ore Falls,"Australia added 12.9k jobs in January, beating the +0k Bloomberg consensus forecast. The jobless rate held steady at the decade-low 4.2%, in line with expectations, while the participation rate increased to 66.2% from 66.1%. The better-than-expected report suggests that the Covid Omicron variant’s drag on the labor market was marginal at best. Although there was a drawdown in hours worked, an expected impact from the new strain. AUD/USD trimmed gains initially but remained higher. Investors await wage inflation data due out next week. The market expectation for an RBA rate hikes this year have grown considerably over the last couple of months. Cash rate futures were pricing in over 100 basis points (bps) of tightening by December, although RBA Governor Philip Lowe remains relatively dovish in his language. The RBA chief signaled earlier this month that the central bank would endure inflation above the 2-3% target range. Currently, core inflation is running at 2.6%, which leaves some room for prices to run higher before meeting that proposition."
Australian Dollar Robust Post GDP Amid War Risks. Will AUD/USD Break the Range?,The Australian Dollar remains elevated amid 4Q quarter-on-quarter GDP coming in at 3.4% against forecasts of 3.5% and a previous 1.9%. This made annual GDP to the end of 2021 4.2% instead of 4.1% anticipated and 3.9% prior. It reveals some upward revisions to previous quarters. Today’s data comes hot on the heels of robust retail sales data on Monday and the RBA leaving monetary policy and the official cash rate unchanged yesterday (Tuesday) at 0.10%.
"Australian Dollar Solid After Ok Jobs Data, CPI Ahead. Will AUD/USD Rally?","The Australian Dollar was little moved after the March unemployment rate came in at 4.0% against the 3.9% forecast and 4.0% previously. The overall change in employment for the month was 18k instead of 30k anticipated. Full time employment increased 21k, while part time jobs decreased 3k. The unemployment rate remains at a 14-year low. Today’s date is ahead of the all-important first quarter CPI number on April 27th. It could prompt the RBA into rates lift-off in the middle of a federal election campaign at their May meeting. The RBA have form in doing so, they raised rates in the middle of an election campaign in November 2007 as inflation was ticking up. The underlying fundamentals remain strong for the Australian economy with trade data remaining positive, although missing expectations earlier this month. The figures revealed a domestic economy in full throttle, with exports steady, but the value of imports surging on the back of local spending. The boost in spot commodity prices, as a result of the Ukraine war, is yet to hit the national balance sheet, as shown in chart below from the RBA. The prices received by exporters is likely to increase over the coming quarters."
